### Please answer the following questions and push your answers to your team's remote repository

For true/false question, if the statement is false, provide a description of why it is false.

- What are some of the difference between the Intel Aero Drone (i.e. a research and development drone) vs other "commercial" or "toy" drones?
- What are some current applications of autonomous drones? Can you think of any future applications as technology improves (e.g. faster, smaller, more efficient computers)?
- Describe the difference between the Aero Compute Board and Aero Flight Controller. What purposes do each serve? What operating systems do each run? Do you know where both of these boards are located on the drone?
- Which communication architecture are we using to connect are computers to the drone: Peer2Peer or centralized? What about the remote control - drone communication?
- True or False: For manual flight control, the remote control communicates with the drone over wifi.
- In order to know where the drone is in the world, it needs some form of positioning sensor/algorithms, otherwise it would be flying blind. What are the different types of positioning sensors available? Which do you think we are going to use during the class?
- True or False: during our indoor flights, we can use the GPS sensor to estimate the drone's position in the world.
- Are optical flow algorithms responsible for mapping the environment? If not, can you describe conceptually what optical flow does?
- Which sensor on the Intel Aero Drone enables 3D visual mapping? 
- How does the Aero Compute Board communicate with the Aero Flight Controller? 
- What is PX4 and where is it running on the drone? 
- Which of these best describes MAVLink: 1. an operating system used on the drone, 2. a sensor on the drone, 3. a communication protocol on the drone, 4. a programming language
- If I want to write a new, complex computer vision algorithm for the drone, should I add it to the Aero Flight Controller firmware? if not, where should I add it and why?
